# LDA-Jive
Topic Modeling of Jive Communities

Use the features of LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) to perform topic modeling of Communities data. 
The data is pulled from the RSS feed of the (Jive)
community, processed into a 'bag of words', and then fed into the LDA algorithm to produce a dynamic page showing
topics/terms.
